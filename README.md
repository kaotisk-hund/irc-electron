# irc-electron

This is a multiplatform IRC client.
Binaries coming in next releases (I guess v0.0.3).

Okay! Let me say what's this about. This is an attempt to make an Irc Client using electron.

The purpose is to share with friends. And thus, make it safe also.

It's under "heavy" development. Tons of mistakes are made in hope I 'll learn from these!

I am open to ideas.
